# Supported Languages - RafGitTools Documentation

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTICE

**This document describes PLANNED future support, not current implementation.**

RafGitTools is currently in active development with documentation available **in English only**. The multilingual support described below is aspirational and represents long-term goals for when the project reaches production maturity.

---

## Current Status

- **Available Now**: English only
- **Planned**: Multilingual support in the future
- **Timeline**: Dependent on project maturity and community interest
- **Priority**: Core development takes precedence over translation

---

## Future Language Goals

If/when the project reaches production readiness and has resources for translation, we would prioritize languages based on:

1. Developer community size
2. Community volunteer availability
3. Resource availability
4. Project stability and documentation maturity

### Potential Priority Languages (Future)

These are **aspirational targets**, not commitments:

**Tier 1 Candidates** (if/when translation begins):
- English (current base language)
- Spanish
- Portuguese (Brazilian)
- Chinese (Simplified)
- Japanese
- German
- French

**Tier 2+ Candidates** (longer-term goals):
- Korean, Russian, Hindi, Arabic
- Italian, Turkish, Polish, Dutch
- Additional languages based on community interest

**Total Possible Languages**: Many languages could potentially be supported in the future, but this depends entirely on:
- Project reaching production status
- Community translation volunteers
- Resources and capacity
- Sustained project success

## Reality Check

### What This Is NOT

❌ **NOT** a commitment to support 52+ languages  
❌ **NOT** currently available in multiple languages  
❌ **NOT** an active translation program  
❌ **NOT** accepting translations at this time  

### What This IS

✅ A vision for future internationalization  
✅ Recognition that global reach requires translation  
✅ Planning documentation for future reference  
✅ Honest about current development status  

---

## How Internationalization Works (Educational)

For future reference, here's how mature projects typically handle internationalization:

1. **Foundation First**: Complete core product in one language
2. **Stabilization**: Ensure product and docs are stable
3. **Infrastructure**: Build translation tools and workflows
4. **Community Building**: Recruit volunteer translators
5. **Gradual Expansion**: Add languages incrementally
6. **Maintenance**: Keep translations updated

This process typically takes **years** for open-source projects.

---

## Current Focus

Right now, RafGitTools is focused on:
- ✅ Core feature development
- ✅ Android app functionality
- ✅ Code quality and testing
- ✅ English documentation

Translation will be considered **after** the project reaches a stable, feature-complete state.

---

**Document Status**: Aspirational Planning Document  
**Current Reality**: English only  
**Version**: 0.1-draft  
**Last Updated**: January 2026

*This document has been revised to honestly reflect the current development status. Previous versions made unrealistic claims about multilingual support that do not reflect reality.*
