# Translation Guide - RafGitTools Documentation

## ⚠️ DEVELOPMENT STATUS

**This is a PLANNING DOCUMENT describing future aspirations.**

RafGitTools is currently in active development. Translation and multilingual support are **planned features for the future**, not current capabilities. This guide describes how translation will work once the project reaches production maturity.

## Current Status

- **Translation Program**: Not yet started
- **Available Languages**: English only
- **Infrastructure**: Planning phase
- **Timeline**: To be determined based on project maturity

## Future Plans

Once RafGitTools reaches a stable, production-ready state, we plan to:

1. **Establish Documentation Foundation**
   - Complete and stabilize English documentation
   - Finalize feature set and terminology
   - Create comprehensive glossary

2. **Build Translation Infrastructure**
   - Set up translation management platform
   - Recruit language coordinators
   - Develop quality standards and workflows

3. **Launch Community Translation**
   - Begin with 5-10 priority languages
   - Open to community contributions
   - Implement review and quality processes

## Planned Quality Standards

When translation begins, we aim to follow:
- Native speaker review
- Technical accuracy validation
- W3C internationalization best practices
- Regular updates and maintenance

## How to Help (Future)

**Not accepting translations yet.** 

When the project is ready:
1. Watch for official announcement
2. Check project status and stability
3. Join translation community if program launches
4. Follow contribution guidelines
