   - **Impact**: Can use HTTPS authentication instead
   - **Priority**: Low - nice-to-have feature

2. **SecurityManager.kt** (1 TODO)
   - GPG signature verification implementation
   - **Impact**: Signature generation works, verification is placeholder
   - **Priority**: Low - edge case feature

## 📋 Normative references and proposed control mapping

The listed laws and reference families were used as planning inputs. The list does not show
that requirements were satisfied or operating effectiveness was assessed.

| Reference family | Intended use | Current evidence state |
|---|---|---|
| GDPR, CCPA and LGPD | Privacy data-flow and user-control design prompts. | `TOKEN_VAZIO` pending scoped legal and runtime review. |
| ISO/IEC, NIST, OWASP and IEEE | Engineering, security and quality review prompts. | `TOKEN_VAZIO` pending mapped controls, receipts and applicable independent review. |
